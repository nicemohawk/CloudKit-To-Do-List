# Hello, this is a simple ToDo List App that is written in Swift and uses CloudKit.

----
## What is CloudKit?
See [Cloud Kit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CloudKit/Reference/CloudKit_Framework_Reference/index.html)

> The Cloud Kit framework provides interfaces for moving data between your app and your iCloud containers. You use Cloud Kit to take your appâ€™s existing data and store it in the cloud so that the user can access it on multiple devices. You can also store data in a public area where all users can access it.

----
## Usage
1. Go to General and sign your application.
2. Go to Capabilities and add iCloud + CloudKit to your application.
3. Make sure that you have an iCloud account active in your simulator. (*it is easiest to use an iCloud account that is associated with the developer id you use to log into CloudKit dashboard*)
